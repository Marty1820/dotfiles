# Marty's Dotfiles

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

These are pretty basic configs with nothing special.

I've modified most of the configs to fit my needs, original sources can be found below for most.

## Thanks to/Original Sources...
