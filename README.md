# Marty's Dots
**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

These are pretty basic configs with nothing special.

I've modified most of the configs to fit my needs, original sources can be found below for most.

## Details
* WM: qtile
* Theme: Dracula
* Cursor: BreezeX-Black
* Terminal: Alacritty

## Dependencies
Trying to reduce the dependencies the best I can but as of now they are:

|Dependency|Description|
|:----------:|:-------------:|
|`qtile`|Window manager|
|`feh`|Fast image viewer used as wallpaper setting utility|
|`picom`|Window compositor.|
|`rofi`|Application launcher|
|`conky`|Auto launches and shows most keybindings|

## Optional Dependencies
These are just what I have setting
+ 'lightdm': Used for the 'dm-tools' to lock the computer
+ 'acpi': used for the battery management
+ 'bluez', 'bluez-utils', & 'blueman': All your bluetooth needs
+ 'scrot': for screenshots. Saves in ~/Pictures/Screenshots by default
+ 'alsa-utils': Kernel sound drivers
+ 'xbacklight' : Controls display brightness
+ 'mononoki' : fonts.
+ 'redshift' : helps with limiting blue light at night

## Thanks to/Original Sources...
* [Distro Tube](https://distro.tube/) and his [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles)
* And of course [Dracula Theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) since I tend to use it on everthing I possibly can.
